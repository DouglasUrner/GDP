Game Design & Programming
=========================

Inspired by Jeremy Gibson Bond's Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development and experimental online course.

First Semester
--------------

### Level 00: Thinking Like A Designer

What does a game designer do? What does a game developer do? What is it that we are trying to make? What are we not going to worry about?

Game design is about iteration.

#### Bartok playtest.

The feel of a game - mechanics vs. aesthetics. Language to describe feel.  Ideas about how to modify the feel.

Possible feels:
* Exciting & cutthroat
* Leisurly and slow
* Strategy vs. chance

Pick a feel, develop some new mechanics (rules) that you think might move the game in the direction that you want. 

#### Intro to computers and Canvas.

Assignment to create a new set of rules for Bartok to make it "better".
